### Message Formats Supported by Kolay TradingView Bot

Kolay TradingView Bot supports several message formats to cater to different use cases. Let‚Äôs explore the key message types that the bot can handle.

#### 1. Simple Text Message

A simple text message is the most basic form of notification you can set up. This format is ideal for those who prefer quick and concise alerts.

**Example**:

- **TradingView Alarm Message**: `{{ticker}} at the dip!`
- **Telegram Message**: `BTCUSDT at the dip!`

Here, the `{{ticker}}` placeholder dynamically inserts the ticker symbol, such as BTCUSDT or ETHUSD, into the message. This way, you‚Äôll always know which asset the alert is referring to.

#### 2. Simple HTML Message

For users who want more styling or rich formatting, the bot also supports HTML-formatted messages. You can use any HTML tags supported by Telegram to customize your alerts.

**Example**:

- **TradingView Alarm Message**: `<b>{{ticker}}</b> reaches {{close}}!`
- **Telegram Message**: `BTCUSDT reaches 1,000,000!`

In this case, the `{{ticker}}` placeholder is bolded with the `<b></b>` HTML tag, and the `{{close}}` placeholder dynamically inserts the current price of the asset.

#### 3. JSON Message

For more advanced use cases, the Kolay TradingView Bot supports JSON-formatted messages. JSON allows you to structure your data more precisely, and you can include additional placeholders like volume, exchange, and more.

**Example**:

- **TradingView Alarm Message**: `{"exchange":"{{exchange}}","ticker":"{{ticker}}","price":"{{close}}","volume":"{{volume}}"}`
- **Telegram Message**:
  ```
  EXCHANGE: BINANCE
  TICKER: BTCUSDT
  PRICE: 1,000,000
  VOLUME: 45
  
  üìä Chart
  ```

This format provides a detailed, structured message with key information about the exchange, ticker, price, and trading volume. It also adds a "üìä Chart" emoji at the end, which is a simple way to enhance your message.

#### 4. JSON Message with ‚ÄúContent‚Äù Property

The Kolay TradingView Bot also allows for a more streamlined message format using the **"content"** property in JSON. The special thing about this property is that the key (`content`) will not appear in the Telegram message ‚Äî only its value is shown.

**Example**:

- **TradingView Alarm Message**: `{"exchange":"{{exchange}}","ticker":"{{ticker}}","price":"{{close}}","content":"It's time to buy."}`
- **Telegram Message**:
  ```
  EXCHANGE: BINANCE
  TICKER: BTCUSDT
  PRICE: 1,000,000
  
  It's time to buy.
  
  üìä Chart
  ```

This format is useful when you want to display a custom message (like "It's time to buy") without the need for an extra key in the output.

### Advanced Tips for Customizing Alerts

Here are some additional tips to make the most out of Kolay TradingView Bot and TradingView‚Äôs webhook features:

#### 1. Use Multiple Placeholders

TradingView provides a range of placeholders that you can use in your alert messages. Here are some of the most common ones:
- **{{ticker}}**: The symbol of the asset (e.g., BTCUSDT, ETHUSD).
- **{{close}}**: The last closing price.
- **{{exchange}}**: The exchange where the asset is traded (e.g., Binance, Coinbase).
- **{{volume}}**: The trading volume.
- **{{time}}**: The time when the alert was triggered.

You can combine multiple placeholders to create dynamic messages with detailed information.

#### 2. Use Conditional Alerts

You can also create more complex alerts on TradingView using conditional logic. For example, you could set an alert when the price crosses a certain threshold and then include relevant market data in the message. 

#### 3. Experiment with Emojis and Formatting

Since the bot supports HTML and rich text formatting, feel free to get creative with emojis, bold text, and other Telegram-supported formatting options. This can help make your alerts stand out, especially in fast-paced trading situations.
